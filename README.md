Pong Clone
=================

A simple Pong clone written in Lua that uses the Love2D game engine (https://love2d.org/).

**How To Play:**
Press ENTER to start. Use W and S to control the left paddle (player 1) and the up and down arrow keys to control the right paddle (player 2). Pressing Q or ESC exits the program and pressing P pauses/unpauses the game. Whichever player misses the ball losses and the program must be restarted to continue playing. 

**Nice to Have Features:**

* More modularized code.
* A score keeping function for the current run of the game, and possibly for the copy of the game.
* Instead of requiring two players, require user input to decide if the user wishes to play against a computer or a person.
* Easier way to pause the game for both players. For instance, left and right Ctrl.
* Receive user input to determine resolution.
* Game play modes: P1 vs. P2, P1 vs. Comp, Comp vs. Comp, Rapid Mode.
