Pong Clone
=================

A simple Pong clone written in Lua that uses the Love2D game engine (https://love2d.org/).

**How To Play:**
Press ENTER to start. Use W and S to control the left paddle (player 1) and the up and down arrow keys to control the right paddle (player 2). Pressing Q or ESC exits the program and pressing P pauses/unpauses the game. Whichever player misses the ball losses and the program must be restarted to continue playing. [A restart function and score keeping function may be implemented in the future]
